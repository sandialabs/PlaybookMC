# BrantleyJQSRT2011 reports that AM results were computed using Gauss-Legendre quadrature of order N=64. The degree of error in these results does not appear to have been directly examined, though through solution of a single realization with a high quadrature order, it is likely small, yielding perhaps at least several and probably many digits of accuracy.  When the benchmark results used the same quadrature (but averaged over 10^5 ensemble realizations), answers agreed with previously published results to 2-3 digits, providing a lower bound on the expected accuracy of the AM results.,,,,
